# UdacityGrowWithGoogle_cinciTourGuide

My tourism app takes you through the city of Cincinnati, OH, which is where I was born and raised before moving out to Montana for school and work and eventually getting married and kids and a dog and blah blah blah blah.

It seemed like everyone was using tabs and a ViewPager to mimic the Miwok app, and I didn't want to do that so I used a navigation drawer and direct fragment movement to get to each part of the app. There are 4 main categories. 2 of those have multiple subcategories. The landmarks category takes you straight to a list of landmarks, and the City History option takes you to a fragment that uses an ExpandableListView element. In the video I said ListFragment though. I also implemented a splash screen.

City History information was mostly obtained through wikipedia.
Location/Activities/Food/etc information came from various sources, either that items webiste, wikipedia, and in some instances the official tour cincinnati website.
