Originally, the square occupied a large island in the middle of Fifth Street with buildings to the north and south.  A 1971 renovation of the square included slightly moving and re-orienting the fountain to the west, and enlarging the plaza by removing the original westbound portion of 5th Street and demolishing buildings to the north. It is used for lunch-breaks, rallies, and other gatherings.",

It was the first railroad bridge spanning the Ohio River between Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky. In 1904, the bridge was renamed the L&N (Louisville and Nashville) Railroad Bridge. Shortly  thereafter, the west portion of the bridge was improved and repaved to accommodate automobiles. In the 1940s, streetcar service over the bridge ceased. Thereafter, outside cantilevered track was removed and the center streetcar track became a pedestrian walkway. In late 2001, the City of Newport and Southbank Partners received $4 million in state funds to paint and restore the bridge. CSX donated its portion of the bridge to the City of Newport, which transferred ownership the bridge to the Newport Southbank Bridge Co., which owns and operates the bridge and oversees its maintenance. Today, the bridge serves as an instrumental pedestrian link between Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky and is a tourist attraction and event venue that has seen substantial development arise around its footprint.",
